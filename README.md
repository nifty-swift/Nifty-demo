Here's a simple example of Nifty in action!

This demo just performs various computations using Nifty. It's intended to give an idea
of what Nifty looks like. Follow the steps below to get Nifty up and running:

- Clone this repository
- Make sure you've met the requirements for [Nifty](https://github.com/nifty-swift/Nifty#getting-started)
- Open a terminal inside your local copy of this repository
- Run `swift build`. You should see the package manager cloning into various repositories to
    gather the needed packages, compiling, and then linking.
- Once the build has completed, execute `.build/debug/Nifty-demo` to run the demo!

   _Look [here](https://github.com/nifty-swift/Nifty#adapt-system-library-paths) if you get linker errors while building_
