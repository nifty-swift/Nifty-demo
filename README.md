Here's a simple example of Nifty in action!

Eventually (hopefully soon!) this demo and accompanying documentation will get much fancier. 
For now, follow the steps below to get Nifty up and running:

- Clone this repository
- Make sure you've met the requirements for [Nifty](https://github.com/nifty-swift/Nifty)
- Open a terminal inside your local copy of this repository
- Run `swift build`. You should see the package manager clone into various repositories to
    gather the needed packages, compiling, and then linking.
- Once the build has completed, execute `.build/debug/Nifty-demo` to run the demo!
