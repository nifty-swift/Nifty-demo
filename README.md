# Nifty Demo

This is a project to demonstrate the use of 
    [Nifty](https://github.com/philipce/nifty).

## Instructions

- Download and install Swift 3 Preview 1.0 
    [here](https://swift.org/download/#snapshots).
- Clone this repository and run the following commands:

```
$ cd nifty-demo
$ swift build
$ .build/debug/NiftyDemo
```

This should build and run a demo application that uses Nifty. The program may 
terminate with errors, but these should be due to asserts failing in Nifty as 
it gets fleshed out.
